		The 'V' sign, made by holding up the index and middle fingers, initially was used to signal victory by Allied nations during World War II. Anti-war activists later adopted it as a symbol of peace, and today the gesture is known as "the peace sign."

	<p>Thumbs up is perhaps the most common of hand gestures and one that has been used for thousands of years. The signal for approval or agreement is commonly found European and American cultures as a sign of approval or that things are going according to plan. The gesture is so prevalent that it is a common emoji and is commonly used in social media and customer service ratings to indicate satisfaction.</p>

<p>However, in many Islamic and Asian countries, it is considered a major insult. In Australia, the gesture also means all is fine unless the user moves it up and down which transfers the gesture to an insult.</p>

<p>The thumbs down gesture is also commonly used in America, but less so in many other countries. The gesture obviously means the opposite of “thumbs up”, however in many cultures it is considered to be very rude and arrogant.</p>

<h1>Two handed signs</h1>

<p>
	Air quotes are made by raising both hands to eye level and flexing the index and middle fingers of both hands while speaking. Their meaning is similar to that of scare quotes in writing.
Añjali Mudrā (namaste) is a sign of respect in India and among yoga practitioners. It is made by pressing the palms together. This is of Indian origin.
Applause is an expression of approval made by clapping the hands together to create repetitive staccato noise. Applause is most appropriate within a group setting, to collectively show approval by the volume, duration, and clamor of the noise.
Awkward turtle is a two handed gesture used to mark a moment as awkward. One hand is placed flat atop the other with both palms facing down, fingers extended outward from the hand and thumbs stuck out to the sides. The thumbs are rotated to symbolize flippers.[35]
Batsu. In Japanese culture, the batsu (literally: ×-mark) is a gesture made by crossing one's arms in the shape of an "X" in front of them in order to indicate that something is "wrong" or "no good".[36]
Bras d'honneur is an obscene gesture made by flexing one elbow while gripping the inside of the bent arm with the opposite hand.
Arms crossed on chest - denotes suspicion or guardedness.

<p>
	The Kohanic or Priestly Blessing – a gesture of benediction in Judaism, used (especially by those of Kohanic or priestly descent) when reciting the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6: 22-26). Both hands are held up, palms toward the congregation, with the fingers grouped in twos – the little and ring fingers together, the index and second fingers together, and the tips of the two thumbs touching.
The golf clap, unlike applause, is a timid and practically silent clapping of the palms together, to silently approve of something. It may be performed when loud applause is inappropriate; however, it may instead be done in mockery or to display faux approval.
Hand-rubbing, rubbing both hands palms together along the fingers' direction may mean that one is expecting or anticipating something or that one feels cold.

U.S. servicemen surrendering with raised hands during the Battle of Corregidor
Hands up is a gesture expressing military surrender by lifting both hands. This may have originated with the concept of exposing one's hands to show one is unarmed and not a threat, and the utility of this gesture is still employed in captures and arrests.[37]

Hand heart
The Dab is a gesture expressing triumph or playfulness in which one's head is dropped into the bent elbow of one arm while raising the opposite arm straight out parallel.
Hand heart is a recent pop culture symbol meaning love. The hands form the shape of a heart.

Jazz hands
Jazz hands are used in dance or other performances by displaying the palms of both hands with fingers splayed.
The Kung fu salute or baoquan li 武术抱拳礼 is a formal demonstration of respect between kung fu practitioners in which the right hand (formed into a fist) is covered by the open left palm.

<p>
	Maru, (literally "circle") in Japanese culture is a gesture made by holding both arms curved over the head with the hands joined, thus forming a circular shape, to express that something is "correct" or "good". This is the counterpart of "batsu", above, though its daily use is not quite as widespread.[36]

The Merkel-Raute
Merkel-Raute: Described as "probably one of the most recognizable hand gestures in the world", the signature gesture of Angela Merkel has become a political symbol used by both her supporters and opponents.[38]
Ogham: There is direct evidence for the existence of a system of ogham hand signals. The ogam tract In Lebor Ogaim mentions two forms of finger spelling; cossogam ('foot-ogham') and sronogam ('nose-ogham'). Cossogam involves putting the fingers to the right or left of the shinbone for the first or second aicmi, and across it diagonally or straight for the third or fourth aicmi. One finger is used for the first letter, two for the second, and so on. Sronogam involves the same procedure with the ridge of the nose. Placing the finger straight across the shinbone or nose for the fourth aicme mimics the later, manuscript form of the letters. Another alphabet, basogam ('palm-ogham') is mentioned which seems to involve striking the hand in various ways against wood. Probably the angle of the hand indicated the aicme while the number of strikes indicated the letter. The inclusion of these alphabets in the Tract shows that a connection between the ogham letters and fingers was still known at the time the Book of Ballymote was written in the Middle Ages. Further evidence of the possible use of ogham hand gestures comes in the form of various literary references to finger signs. Plummer (1910 p cxvi) cites several works which mention the use of finger signs, including the Life of Saint Brendan.</p>
