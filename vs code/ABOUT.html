<h1>what is Hand Gestures</h1>
<div class="text">
	<p1> Gestures are a form of nonverbal communication in which visible bodily actions are used to communicate important messages, either in place of speech or together and in parallel with spoken words.Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body. Physical non-verbal communication such as purely expressive displays, proxemics, or displays of joint attention differ from gestures, which communicate specific messages.Gestures are culture-specific and may convey very different meanings in different social or cultural settings.Hand gestures used in the context of public speaking or musical conducting are chironomy,while those used in an elaborate system of specific communication are known as sign language.</p1>
<p2>Although some gestures, such as the ubiquitous act of pointing, differ little from one place to another, most gestures do not have invariable or universal meanings, but connote specific meanings in particular cultures. A single emblematic gesture may have very different significance in different cultural contexts, ranging from complimentary to highly offensive.

This list includes links to pages that discuss particular gestures, as well as short descriptions of some gestures that do not have their own page. Not included are the specialized gestures, calls, and signals used by referees and umpires in various organized sports. Policemen also make gestures when directing traffic. Miming is an art form in which the performer uses gestures to convey a story; charades is a game of gestures. Mimed gestures might generally be used to refer to an action in context, for example turning a pretend crank to ask someone to lower a car side window (or for modern power windows, pointing down or miming pressing a button). </p2>

<h3>Fingerspelling in sign language</h3>

<img src="hand signs pic.jpg" alt="Hand Signs"  class="img">
<br>
<div class="text">
	<p3>Fingerspelling has been introduced into certain sign languages by educators and as such has some structural properties that are unlike the visually motivated and multi-layered signs that are typical in deaf sign languages. In many ways fingerspelling serves as a bridge between the sign language and the oral language that surrounds it.</p3>
<p4 class="big">
Fingerspelling is used in different sign languages and registers for different purposes. It may be used to represent words from an oral language that have no sign equivalent or for emphasis or clarification or when teaching or learning a sign language.
<br>
[1]In American Sign Language (ASL) more lexical items are fingerspelled in casual conversation than in formal or narrative signing.
<br>
[2] Different sign language speech communities use fingerspelling to a greater or lesser degree. At the high end of the scale
<br>
[3] fingerspelling makes up about 8.7% of casual signing in ASL[2] and 10% of casual signing in Auslan.
<br>
[4] The proportion is higher in older signers. Across the Tasman Sea only 2.5% of the corpus of New Zealand Sign Language was found to be fingerspelling.
<br>
[5] Fingerspelling did not become a part of NZSL until the 1980s.
<br>
[6] Before that words could be spelled or initialised by tracing letters in the air.
<br>
[7] Fingerspelling does not seem to be used much in the sign languages of Eastern Europe except in schools.
<br>
[8] and Italian Sign Language is also said to use very little fingerspelling, and mainly for foreign words. Sign languages that make no use of fingerspelling at all include Kata Kolok and Ban Khor Sign Language.
<br>
</p4>

<p5>The speed and clarity of fingerspelling also vary among different signing communities. In Italian Sign Language fingerspelled words are produced relatively slowly and clearly, whereas fingerspelling in standard British Sign Language (BSL) is often rapid so that the individual letters become difficult to distinguish and the word is grasped from the overall hand movement. Most of the letters of the BSL alphabet are produced with two hands but when one hand is occupied the dominant hand may fingerspell onto an imaginary subordinate hand and the word can be recognised by the movement. As with written words, the first and last letters and the length of the word are the most significant factors for recognition.

When people fluent in sign language read fingerspelling they do not usually look at the signer's hand(s) but maintain eye contact, as is normal for sign language. People who are learning fingerspelling often find it impossible to understand it using just their peripheral vision and must look straight at the hand of someone who is fingerspelling. Often they must also ask the signer to fingerspell slowly. It frequently takes years of expressive and receptive practice to become skilled with fingerspelling.</p5>

	Chinese number gestures are a method to signify the natural numbers one through ten using one hand. This method may have been developed to bridge the many varieties of Chinese—for example, the numbers 4 (Chinese: 四; pinyin: sì) and 10 (Chinese: 十; pinyin: shí) are hard to distinguish in some dialects. Some suggest that it was also used by business people during bargaining (i.e., to convey a bid by feeling the hand gesture in a sleeve) when they wish for more privacy in a public place. These gestures are fully integrated into Chinese Sign Language.</p6>
	<br>
	<p7>
	<h3>MENTODS</h3>
	While the five digits on one hand can easily express the numbers one through five, six through ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication. The gestures are rough representations of the Chinese numeral characters they represent. The system varies in practice, especially for the representation of "7" to "10". Two of the systems are listed below:
<p7>
<h4>	Zero (〇)<h4>
Northern China: The fist is closed. This may be interpreted as 10 depending on the situation, though some Chinese distinguish between zero and ten by having the thumb closed or open, respectively.
Coastal southern China: The thumb and index finger make a circle, with the other three fingers closed.
<h4>One (一)</h4>
The index finger is extended.
<h4>Two (二)</h4>
The index and middle fingers are extended.
<h4>Three (三)</h4>
The thumb and index finger are closed and the other three fingers are extended.
The thumb holds the little finger down in the palm and the middle three fingers are extended.
<h4>Four (四)</h4>
The thumb is held in the palm and the four fingers are extended.
<h4>Five (五)</h4>
All five digits are extended.
Only the thumb is extended (either upwards or outwards) with the palm facing the signer.
Counting with fingers is often different from expressing a specific number with a finger gesture. When counting, the palm can be either facing its owner or the audience, depending on the purpose. Before counting, all fingers are closed; counting starts by extending the thumb as the first, then the index finger as the second, until all fingers are extended as the fifth; then counting can be continued by folding fingers with the same sequence, from thumb through the little finger, for counting from the sixth through the tenth. Repeating the same method for counting larger numbers. One can also starts counting with all fingers extended. Some believe that for formal scenario such as giving speech or presentation, counting with the palm facing the audience and starting with all fingers extended is more polite, since the gesture of folding of fingers representing bowing.</p7>

<p8>When playing drinking finger games (划拳, 猜拳), slightly different sets of finger gestures of numbers is used. One of them is:

<h4>Zero (〇)</h4>
The fist is closed.
<h4>One (一)</h4>
The thumb is extended with all other fingers folded toward the palm.
<h4>Two (二)</h4>
The thumb and index finger make an "L", other fingers closed.
<h4>Three (三)</h4>
With the last two fingers closed and the rest fingers (the thumb and the first two fingers) extended, or
With the index finger and thumb closed, the last three fingers are extended.
<h4>Four (四)</h4>
The thumb is held in palm with the four fingers extended.
<h4>Five (五)</h4>
All five digits are extended.
</p8>
<p9>

<h4>Six (六)</h4>
The little finger and thumb are extended (the extended thumb indicating one set of 5); the other fingers are closed, sometimes with the palm facing the signer.
<h4>Seven (七)</h4>
Northern China: The fingertips are all touching, pointed upwards, or just the fingertips of the thumb and first two fingers (the most common method); another method is similar to the eight (described below) except that the little finger is also extended.
Northern China: The index finger and middle finger point outward, with the thumb extended upwards (the extended thumb indicating one set of 5), sometimes with the palm facing the observer.
Coastal southern China: The index finger points down with the thumb extended, mimicking the shape of a "7".
<h4>Eight (八)</h4>
Northern China: The thumb and index finger make an "L" and the other fingers are closed, with the palm facing the observer.
Northern China: The index finger and middle finger point down and with the fingertips optionally touching a horizontal surface, making the Chinese number 8 ("八").
Coastal southern China: The thumb, index finger, and middle finger are extended.
<h4>Nine (九)</h4>
Mainland China: The index finger makes a hook and the other fingers are closed, sometimes with the palm facing the signer.
Taiwan: Four of the five digits of the hand are extended, the exception being the little finger.
Hong Kong: Both methods are used.
<h4>Ten (十)</h4>
The fist is closed with the palm facing the signer, or the middle finger crosses an extended index finger, facing the observer. Some Chinese distinguish between zero and ten by having the thumb closed or open, respectively.[1]
The arms are raised and the index fingers of both hands are crossed in a "十" (making the Chinese number ten) with the palms facing in opposite directions, optionally with the hands placed in front of the signer's face.
Use of the signs corresponds to the use of numbers in the Chinese language. For instance, the sign for five just as easily means fifty. A two followed by a six, using a single hand only, could mean 260 or 2600 etc. besides twenty-six. These signs also commonly refer to days of the week, starting from Monday, as well as months of the year, whose names in Chinese are enumerations.</p9>
