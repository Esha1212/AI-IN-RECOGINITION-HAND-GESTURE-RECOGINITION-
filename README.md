# AI-IN-RECOGINITION-HAND-GESTURE-RECOGINITION-
Hand gesture recognition system received great attention in the recent few years because of its manifoldness applications and the ability to interact with machine efficiently through human  computer interaction. In this project, survey of recent hand gesture recognition systems is 
presented. 
Key issues of hand gesture recognition system are presented with challenges of gesture system. 
Review methods of recent postures and gestures recognition system presented as well. Summary 
of research results of hand gesture methods, databases, and comparison between main gesture 
recognition phases are also given. There are many Advantages and drawbacks are also of the 
Hand gesture recognition.
The project introduces an application using computer vision for Hand gesture recognition. A
camera, detects hand movements in the frame, and draws lines on the image to show the 
movement of the hands.
Later we can trained our system for each type of count hand gestures (one, two, three, four, and 
five) at least once.
